Test Test - learning how to GitHub
I want to get into GitHub to use it for my Master's Thesis, a kind-of data science project that is sure to involve a lot of R code that will be continuously imroved and updated, since I'm no expert (yet). 
Already, I am having trouble keeping track of my changes and code snippets and bringing them all together under one Github roof seems like the sensible thing to do. 
At the same time, I'm learning a new tool. Double win.
